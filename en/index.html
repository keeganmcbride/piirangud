  <h1>Restrictions in force</h1>

<p><strong>People continue to have an obligation to wear a mask or cover their nose and mouth in public indoor spaces, including public transportation.</strong></p>
<p>The obligation to wear a mask or cover one's nose and mouth is in force in public indoor spaces, including public transportation and service facilities (except for children under the age of 12 or in cases where wearing a mask is not possible due to health considerations, special needs, the nature of the work or activity, or some other substantial reason). A public indoor space is a space designated for public use that can be entered by anyone wishing to do so, without, for instance, a requirement to register in advance; it is a space densely populated with people who do not come into daily contact with each other.</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>The 2+2 rule is still in force in all public indoor spaces</strong></p>
<p>The so-called 2+2 rule must be followed in all public indoor spaces, which means that up to two people may move around together, keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from other people. For instance, this rule is in force in the bank office, museum, exhibitions, hair and beauty salons, the lobbies of accommodation providers but also in water parks, swimming pools, saunas. The restriction does not apply to a family moving around together, or if it is not possible to ensure this reasonably, for instance if there are many passengers in public transportation, where, in addition to keeping a maximum possible distance, a mask must also be worn.</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>A 50% maximum occupancy requirement still applies in the sales space of a store, service area of a service provider and the common spaces of a commercial establishment</strong></p>
<p>It must be ensured that the occupancy does not exceed 50% and that the so-called 2+2 rule is followed within that 50% occupancy in all indoor stores, service areas of service providers and common spaces of commercial establishments. This means that first it must be calculated how much 50% of the floor space of the room in public use is and, as customers also have to follow the 2+2 rule, this 50% must be divided by 4 so that each customer would get 4m2.</p>
<hr>
